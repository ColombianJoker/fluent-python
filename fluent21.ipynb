The `async def` statement always defines a native coroutine, even if the `await` keyword is not used in its body. The `await` keyword cannot be used outside of a native coroutine.\n",

Classic coroutines can delegate to other classic coroutines using `yield from`. Classic coroutines cannot be driven by `await`, and are no longer supported by _asyncio_.\n",
