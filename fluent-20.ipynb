    "> The people bashing threads are typically system programmers which have in mind use cases that the typical application programmer will never encounter in her life. [...] In 99% of the use cases an application programmer is likely to run into, the simple pat‐ tern of spawning a bunch of independent threads and collecting the results in a queue is everything one needs to know.\n",

    "The main features of the `concurrent.futures` package are the `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ProcessPoolExecutor` classes, which implement an API to submit callables for execution in different threads or processes, respectively. The classes transparently manage a pool of worker threads or processes, and queues to distribute jobs and collect results. But the interface is very high-level, and we don’t need to know about any of those details for a simple use case like our flag downloads."
